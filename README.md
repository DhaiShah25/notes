# Notes Server

This is a simple notes server I created for school.

## Features

- toml syntax file
- adding arbitrary css and js
- djot parsing using [jotdown](https://github.com/hellux/jotdown)
- recursive directory searching using [walkdir](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir)
- low dependency count for quick builds for development
